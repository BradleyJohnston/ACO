# ACO

This is an implementation in Unity of the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem

This also includes an impleementation of Poisson Disc Sampling in order to generate points.

Eventually I want to create a Neural Network to determine the best parameters to use for a given
input parameters. There are more things to play with here, but I think I will come back to this eventually
